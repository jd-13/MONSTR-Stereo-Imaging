# MONSTR-Stereo-Imaging
MONSTR is a multiband stereo imaging plugin, available in VST, VST3 and Audio Unit formats. MONSTR allows the user to control the stereo width of a sound in 3 different frequency bands, and so can be used to perform common tasks such as narrowing the bass frequencies while adding width to the highs.
